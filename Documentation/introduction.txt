Introduction

The TCD uses ultrasound principle where the change in frenquency caused by Doppler effect to measure the velocity of blood flow

TCD Ultrasonography is difficult to set up as the experimenters are required
to have a set of skill to properly place the probe in the correct location in
order to gain the strongest signal.

However, even after getting the probe to correct location and angle, the probe
can still easily slip away from the position due to minor movement from the 
subject such as head movement, sneezing, coughs. involuntary facial gestures or
due to external forces.

In addition, the probe can not be tightly secured to prevent these error displacement
from occuring as it will cause discomfort for the subject. Hence the motorTCD
is introduced as an alternate solution to allow the experimenters to 
re-adjust the probe back to the position with strongest signal in case misdiplacement
occurs.
